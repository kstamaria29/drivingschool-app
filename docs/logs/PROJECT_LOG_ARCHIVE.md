- **Date:** 2026-02-04 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Bootstrap mobile app (Auth + Onboarding)
- **Summary:**
  - Initialized Expo React Native + TypeScript project structure and configured tablet portrait orientation.
  - Added NativeWind + Tailwind setup and introduced shared UI primitives (`Screen`, `AppText`, `AppButton`, `AppInput`, `AppCard`, `AppStack`).
  - Implemented React Navigation with `AuthStack` and `MainTabs`, plus an auth gate that checks Supabase session and routes first-time users into onboarding.
  - Added Supabase client setup for Expo/React Native (AsyncStorage + URL polyfill) and public env var wiring via `.env`.
  - Implemented email/password auth (sign in + sign up) and onboarding flow to create an organization + owner profile and optionally upload an org logo to Storage.
  - Added Supabase SQL migrations for `organizations`, `profiles`, `organization_settings`, required triggers, RLS policies, and onboarding RPC.
  - Added Storage bucket policy SQL for `org-logos` access rules (read within org; owner-only write).
  - Updated README with step-by-step Supabase setup + running instructions.
  - Fixed setup issues encountered during bootstrap:
    - TypeScript JSX config error (`Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided`).
    - Metro bundling error for missing `babel-preset-expo`.
    - Supabase `gotrue-js` lock timeout warnings (singleton client + retry); silenced third-party SafeAreaView deprecation warning.
