# Project Logs Index

- Active log (latest 20 entries): `PROJECT_LOG.md`
- Archive log (older entries): `docs/logs/PROJECT_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`
- Log format is compact: keep only `Date`, `Task`, and short `Summary` bullets.
- Do not store `Files changed`, `Commands run`, or `How to verify` in log files.
- Log maintenance helper: `scripts/logs/compact-project-logs.ps1`
