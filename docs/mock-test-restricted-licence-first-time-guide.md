# Mock Test - Restricted Licence: First-Time User Guide

This guide is for driving instructors using the Mock Test - Restricted Licence assessment for the first time.
It uses simple language and follows the same order you will see on screen.

## 1. What this assessment is for

Use this assessment to run a practice restricted licence test and record:

- Task faults in Stage 1 and Stage 2
- Critical errors
- Immediate failure errors
- Coaching notes
- Repetitions (how many times each task was attempted)

At the end, you can save the assessment and optionally generate a PDF report.

## 2. Before you start

Before opening the assessment, confirm:

- You selected the correct student
- The student has their licence details up to date
- You know the route and traffic conditions for today
- Your tablet battery is sufficient for the full drive

## 3. How to open the assessment

You can start from either place:

1. `Assessments` screen -> `Start Restricted Mock Test`
2. `Student Profile` -> `Start Assessment` -> `Mock Test - Restricted Licence`

## 4. Step-by-step: Start the test

1. On the details screen, choose the student.
2. Fill in pre-drive details:
- Date of mock test
- Time (optional)
- Vehicle
- Route / area
- Pre-drive notes (optional)
3. Tap `Review and start`.
4. Confirm details.
5. Tap `Start test`.

If you leave and come back later, the app can offer to resume your saved draft for that student on that device.

## 5. Understand the layout on test screen

- The top area stays visible: Header and Session overview.
- Once the test has started, the student name is shown at the top of the Session overview card.
- The sections below are scrollable.
- Stage 1, Critical errors, and Immediate failure errors start hidden by default.
- Only one section can be open at a time (Stage 1, Stage 2, Critical errors, or Immediate failure errors).

### Show/Hide colors

- Stage and error sections:
- `Show` text is blue
- `Hide` text is red

## 6. Stage 1 workflow (basic tasks)

1. Tap `Show` on Stage 1.
2. Tap a task (for example, right turn giving way) to open the task popup.
3. Enter location/reference if needed.
4. Mark faults using the task buttons in the popup:
- Buttons are shown in 2 columns
- Tap once to mark Fault (button turns red)
- Tap again to clear it back to OK / n/a
5. Add task notes if needed.
6. When one attempt of that task is complete, tap `Record Repetition` (green button, top right in the popup).
7. Confirm in the popup, then tap `Close` to return to the task list.

You can record multiple repetitions for the same task.
Tip: After you record a repetition, the task fault buttons reset back to OK / n/a (ready for the next attempt).

## 7. Stage 2 workflow (higher-demand tasks)

- Stage 2 may be locked at first.
- Enable Stage 2 only if Stage 1 performance is safe enough to continue.
- Use the same process as Stage 1:
- Tap a task to open the popup
- Mark faults
- Add notes
- Record repetition

## 8. Critical errors

1. Tap `Show` in `Critical errors`.
2. Use `+` and `-` to increase or reduce each error count.
3. Add notes about what happened and where.

Use this section to record serious issues that happened during the route.

## 9. Immediate failure errors

1. Tap `Show` in `Immediate failure errors`.
2. Use `+` and `-` to record any immediate fail event.
3. Add notes.

Important: Any immediate failure error means the mock result is an automatic fail.

## 10. Repetitions: what they mean and where to see them

Repetition means one completed attempt of a task.

- Each task shows its own repetition total under the task name.
- Each stage shows a total repetition count under the stage heading.
- Session overview also reflects stage totals while you assess.
Tip: Tasks that have repetitions recorded will be highlighted with an orange border in the task list.

## 11. Submit options

At the bottom of the test screen:

- `Submit`: saves assessment only
- `Submit and Generate PDF`: saves assessment and creates PDF report

After submitting, the assessment is saved to student history.

## 12. View saved results later

1. Open the student profile.
2. Open `Assessment History`.
3. Select `Mock Test - Restricted`.

You can review:

- Stage 1 and Stage 2 faults
- Repetition totals
- Critical and immediate errors
- Notes

You can also download the PDF from history.

## 13. Practical tips for instructors

- Keep notes short and specific (what happened, where, and why it matters).
- Record repetitions immediately after each attempt so counts stay accurate.
- If a button was marked Fault by mistake, tap it again to clear.
- If an error count is too high by mistake, use `-` to correct it.
- Use Stage 1 outcome to decide whether Stage 2 is appropriate.
- Use the final notes to set clear coaching priorities for the next lesson.

## 14. Quick checklist (first session)
