- **Date:** 2026-02-08 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Student delete warning + history cascade cleanup + licence photo UI polish
- **Summary:**
  - Updated student delete API flow to remove related `student_sessions` and `assessments` records before deleting the student row.
  - Kept storage cleanup on delete and now removes all files under `student-licenses/<organization_id>/<student_id>/` as part of the delete flow.
  - Updated Student Profile delete confirmation message to include an explicit warning when session history, assessment history, or licence photos exist, reminding users those records will be permanently removed.
  - Updated Student Profile licence photo block so missing sides no longer render placeholders; each side now shows `Add Front Licence photo` / `Add Back Licence photo` when missing.
  - Updated Add/Edit Student licence photo block with the same missing-side behavior and removed Front/Back caption labels.

- **Date:** 2026-02-08 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Delete student licence files on student delete + crop-label feasibility check
- **Summary:**
  - Updated student delete flow to first fetch the student's `organization_id`, delete all files under `student-licenses/<organization_id>/<student_id>/`, then delete the student row.
  - This ensures licence front/back images are removed from Supabase Storage when a student is deleted.
  - Verified `expo-image-picker` docs: crop UI action text is native/system-controlled; current Expo API does not expose a setting to rename `CROP` to `Ok`.

- **Date:** 2026-02-08 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Reset Students filters on revisit + student photo options UX polish
- **Summary:**
  - Updated `Students` screen focus behavior so every re-entry resets controls to defaults: `Status=Active`, `Sort=Recent`, `By organization=Off`, organization selection reset, `View other instructor's students=Hide`, `Search` cleared, and pagination reset to page 1.
  - Updated `Edit student` assignable instructor list to always exclude `admin` role entries.
  - Replaced licence photo action alerts in both `Edit student` and `Student profile` with explicit modal action sheets that include top-right `X` close and `Cancel` button.
  - Updated `Student profile` licence photos area:
    - moved `Organization` below `Age`,
    - added spacing between `Expiry date` and `Licence card photos`,
    - centered `Front`/`Back` labels,
    - when both photos are missing, hide front/back placeholders/headings and show `Add Front Licence photo` / `Add Back Licence photo` actions.

- **Date:** 2026-02-08 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Refine student licence photo management + add date of birth
- **Summary:**
  - Added `students.date_of_birth` support end-to-end (migration `018`, Supabase types, Add/Edit form field with date picker, save/update mapping, and profile display).
  - Updated Student Profile to display `Address: <value>` inline, show date of birth and computed age, and capitalize licence type labels (`Learner`, `Restricted`, `Full`).
  - Added profile-level licence photo management: each side now has `photo options` to take photo, pick from library, and delete existing photo.
  - Updated Add/Edit Student licence photo options to support crop-enabled capture/picking (`allowsEditing` + aspect), side-by-side Front/Back layout, and delete-on-save behavior for existing photos.
  - Removed `Clear issue date` and `Clear expiry date` buttons from Add/Edit Student.
  - Added focused-notes keyboard assist on Add/Edit Student by scrolling to end on notes focus so lower input stays visible above the keyboard.

- **Summary:**
  - Added student licence photo upload support in the student feature API/query layer with storage upload + signed URL persistence (`license_front_image_url`, `license_back_image_url`).
  - Added Supabase migration `017_students_license_images.sql` and storage policy script for private `student-licenses` bucket paths (`<organization_id>/<student_id>/<front|back>.<ext>`).

- **Date:** 2026-02-08 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Refine student assignment dropdown + organization show-all order + profile action placement
- **Summary:**
  - Updated `New student` owner/admin assignment UX to use an instructor dropdown instead of listing all instructor buttons.
  - Added a left-aligned trigger button label (`Assign new student to an Instructor`) with centered dropdown choices and centered selected state text.
  - Added fallback behavior for owner/admin create flow: if no instructors exist in the organization, the Assigned Instructor block is hidden and assignment defaults to the logged-in user.
  - Updated Students organization filtering with `Show all` and `Other's (not listed)` options; `Show all` now excludes `Private` and orders results as `Other's (not listed)` -> `Renaissance` -> `Lifeskill` -> `UMMA Trust`.
  - Removed `1H` from Class held options on `New/Edit student`.
  - Removed the `Danger zone` container and moved `Archive/Delete student` actions back to the bottom action stack under `Assessment History` with spacing.

  - Test owner/admin org with no instructors and confirm `Assigned Instructor` block is hidden and save still works.
  - Open `Students`, toggle `By organization` to `On`, choose `Show all`, and confirm `Private` students are excluded and group ordering follows `Other's (not listed)` -> `Renaissance` -> `Lifeskill` -> `UMMA Trust`.

- **Task:** Group other instructors' students in assessment pickers
- **Summary:**
  - Updated `Driving Assessment`, `Mock Test - Restricted Licence`, and `Mock Test - Full License` student pickers so owner/admin `Show` mode no longer mixes all students in one list.

- **Date:** 2026-02-07 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Assessments student filtering toggle + full mock optional spoken fields
- **Summary:**
  - Updated all three assessment student selectors (`Driving Assessment`, `Mock Test - Restricted Licence`, `Mock Test - Full License`) so owner/admin default view hides other instructors' students.
  - Added a right-aligned `Other Instructor's Students` segmented toggle (`Hide`/`Show`) on the same row as the `Student` heading in those three assessment screens.
  - Kept instructor behavior unchanged and applied filtering only to owner/admin by matching `assigned_instructor_id` to the current user when toggle is `Hide`.
  - In `Mock Test - Full License`, made `Hazard(s) spoken` and `Action spoken` optional by removing blocking validation checks and updating field labels to optional.
  - Updated Students screen owner toggle label text from `View Instructor's Students` to `View other instructor's students`.

- **How to verify:**
  - Open each assessment screen as owner/admin and confirm `Other Instructor's Students` toggle appears on the Student header row, defaulting to `Hide`.
  - With toggle on `Hide`, confirm only self-assigned students are listed; switch to `Show` and confirm additional instructor-assigned students appear.
  - Open `Mock Test - Full License` and confirm `Hazard(s) spoken` and `Action spoken` labels display `(optional)` and attempts can be recorded without entering those fields.
  - Open `Students` as owner/admin and confirm label now reads `View other instructor's students`.
  - Run `npx tsc --noEmit` and confirm no type errors.

- **Date:** 2026-02-07 (Pacific/Auckland)
- **Task:** Refactor Batch 2+3: query invalidation helpers + shared async UI states
- **Summary:**
  - Added `invalidateQueriesByKey` helper to centralize parallel React Query cache invalidation calls and reduced duplicated invalidation blocks in account/profile/student/lesson mutations.
  - Added reusable async-state UI primitives (`CenteredLoadingState`, `ErrorStateCard`, `EmptyStateCard`) for consistent loading/error/empty rendering.
  - Refactored `Home`, `Lessons`, `Students`, and `View Members` screens to use shared async-state components without changing routes, feature behavior, or API contracts.
  - Introduced low-risk key constants/helpers (`students`/`lessons` roots and `profileKeys.memberRoot`) to remove repeated raw query-key arrays.

  - Open `Lessons` list and confirm loading state still appears while monthly lessons fetch.
  - Open `Students` and verify loading/error/empty cards still display the same messages and retry behavior for both main list and owner/admin member-dependent blocks.
  - Open `Settings` -> `View members` and confirm loading/error/retry behavior is unchanged.
